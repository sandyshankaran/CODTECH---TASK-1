OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

project:  BLINKING OF LED WITH A TIME DELAY

Objective :

To demonstrate basic digital output control and timing functions on the Arduino platform by creating a simple LED blinking system.

Specific Goals:

Learn Basic Arduino Functions:
   - Understand how to use digital output pins to control external components.
   - Learn to use the `pinMode()`, `digitalWrite()`, and `delay()` functions in Arduino programming.
Visualize Digital Output Control:
   - Create a visual feedback mechanism (blinking LED) to observe the effects of digital signal changes on external hardware.
Understand Timing and Delays:
   - Implement timing delays to control the duration for which the LED is turned on and off, illustrating how to manage timing in embedded systems.
Build a Foundation for More Complex Projects:
   - Gain practical experience with basic Arduino programming and hardware connections, serving as a foundation for more advanced projects involving sensors, actuators, and more complex logic.

Applications and Benefits:

Educational Tool: Ideal for beginners to learn fundamental concepts of electronics and programming.
Debugging and Testing: Useful for testing basic output functionality and verifying that the Arduino board and connections are working correctly.
Foundation for Development: Provides a basic understanding that can be applied to more complex projects involving multiple LEDs, sensors, and other components.
